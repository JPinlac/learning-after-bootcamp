# The Road to Junior Developer
### My chronicles of eventually getting hired as junior web developer. :grin:

I'm the type of person who spends way too much time finding the most time efficient way to comprehensively learn something. I even obsess over what to learn in the first place and endlessly question that decision after the fact. I hate wasting my time. This usually ends up horribly backfiring and I end up wasting more time researching options than actually learning. Even after all this, there will always be some nonoptimal decisions and hindsight is almost 20/20. So I'm hoping some of you can use this guide to save some time on deciding what to do and actually do things.   
__TL;DR: Hopefully, you can use my succeses and mistakes to help guide your journey as a developer.__

## Chronicles
#### Why
#### My Background
#### BootCamp
#### Learning after bootcamp

There seems to be a recurring theme with coding. __The more you learn the less you think you know.__ This was never more apparent than with the bootcamp. We learned about all the technologies we could use to make a decent web application, but working 40 hours a week and cramming all that info in about 10 weeks didn't allow for in-depth learning. There's a lot nuances in all the code that I have to familiarize myself with. __So, it's back to the basics.__ 

*The format of the upcoming sections will be peculiar. It will be a living section with me explaining what I'm using to learn and highlighting some cool things I came across. In the future I hope to explain how each element corresponds within the bigger picture of a web application*

###### HTML/CSS

First item the list, HTML and CSS. The basic building blocks of a website. You can make a very nice fully functioning website with just these tools. They've also come a very long way with the introduction of HTML5 and CSS3. There's cool things like more sematic markup and positioning with flexboxes. There's also a lot of things you should be aware of, such as web accesibility and making sure your page is properly formatted for SEO (search engine optimization). 

*My game plan for studying will roughly be at least two hours studying material or working on a personal project every weekday. At least an hour because it's easy to get caught up coding and lose track of time :smiley: I'll keep a log of all the time I spend on learning as well.*

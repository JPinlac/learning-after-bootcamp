# The Road to Junior Developer :grin:
###### My chronicles of eventually getting hired as junior web developer.

I'm the type of person who spends way too much time finding the most time efficient way to comprehensively learn something. I even obsess over what to learn in the first place and endlessly questioning that decision after the fact. I hate wasting my time. This usually ends up horribly backfiring since I end up wasting more time researching options than actually learning. After all the painstaking obsessing over what to learn, there will still be some not optimal decisions and hindsight is almost 20/20.  
__TL;DR: Hopefully, you can use my succeses and mistakes to help guide your journey as a developer.__

## Why



## History

As of December 18th, I will have completed a part-time front end development bootcamp at Grand Circus in Detroit. The bootcamp covered so much material I couldn't help but feel a little lost. The limited time frame of about 10 weeks while working 40 hours a week doesn't allow much time for independent study. Am I able to scrounge up a basic web application? Yes. Is it pretty? No.

Luckily, my circumstances we're a little more forgiving. My current job is pretty flexible about on the job learning.

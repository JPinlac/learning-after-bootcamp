# The Road to Junior Developer
### My chronicles of eventually getting hired as junior web developer. :grin:

I'm the type of person who spends way too much time finding the most time efficient way to comprehensively learn something. I even obsess over what to learn in the first place and endlessly question that decision after the fact. I hate wasting my time. This usually ends up horribly backfiring and I end up wasting more time researching options than actually learning. Even after all this, there will always be some nonoptimal decisions and hindsight is still not quite 20/20. So I'm hoping some of you can use this guide to save some time on deciding what to do and actually do things.   
__TL;DR: Hopefully, you can use my succeses and mistakes to help guide your journey as a developer.__

*The format of the upcoming learning sections will be peculiar. It will be a living document with me explaining what I'm using to learn and highlighting some cool things I came across. So a lot of this information will be fragmented and not in chronological order. You can track my progress in order in the [log here](#log).*

## Chronicles
#### Why
#### My Background
#### BootCamp
#### Learning after bootcamp

There seems to be a recurring theme with coding. __The more you learn the less you think you know.__ This was never more apparent than after the bootcamp. We learned about all the technologies we could use to make a decent web application, but working 40 hours a week and cramming all that info in about 10 weeks didn't allow for in-depth learning. There's a lot nuances and depth in all the code that we have to familiarize ourselves with. __So, it's back to the basics.__ 


###### HTML/CSS

HTML and CSS, the basic building blocks of a website. You can make a very nice fully functioning website with just these tools. They've also come a very long way with the introduction of HTML5 and CSS3. There's cool things like more sematic markup and positioning with flexboxes. There's also a lot of things you should be aware of, such as web accesibility and making sure your page is properly formatted for SEO (search engine optimization). 

I currently have a copy of [*HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites by John Duckett*] (#HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites by John Duckett) that I bought in the beginning of the bootcamp. His books are wonderfully illustrated and perfect for beginners. This book is a pretty quick read, I spent a night going through it earlier and went through about 1/5th of the book. 

I'll also be going through the MOOC (massive open onlince course) [HTML5 Part 1: HTML5 Coding Essentials and Best Practices](https://www.edx.org/course/html5-part-1-html5-coding-essentials-w3cx-html5-1x).

## Extras

### Courses

I plan on roughly following the guide that is here [Open Source Society](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science) and supplementing with other materials than I think will be useful.

[HTML5 Part 1: HTML5 Coding Essentials and Best Practices](https://www.edx.org/course/html5-part-1-html5-coding-essentials-w3cx-html5-1x)  
Excellent course on web accesibility and html5 features by WC3. I completed a couple weeks of this before things were getting too intense during the bootcamp. Unfortunately, this course isn't active, but all all the information is available in the archive.

[Harvard CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x#!)  
This course is self-paced and looks to offer a good overview on programming concepts. Enrollment starts on Jan 1st, 2016 if active engagement is your thing, so this is a good time to start.

[MIT 6.0.0.1x: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-6#!)  
This course starts January 13th, 2016. I also took this course last year and while I did earn a certificate, I did the bare minimum. Bootcamp was getting time consuming at the time and I wasn't able to delve into the harder concepts. I'm pretty excited about taking this course again. It's very algorithm heavy and covers basic computer science concepts loops all the way to recursion, data structures, Big-O complexity, and testing. I took EECS 280 at the University of Michigan and I'm pretty impressed on how much material and more is covered in this MITx course.

### Book List

[*HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites by John Duckett*] (http://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189) 
Wonderfully illustrated book that's perfect for beginners. It's a quick read.

[Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)  
The best resource on learning javascript. It's less opinionated and more up to date than Crockford's *Javascript: The Good Parts.* It's online, it's free, what's not to like. Can't wait to get into it.

### Learning and productivity tricks

[Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/)  
Have you ever had to spend an all nighter cramming information in your head trying to get ready for a midterm? Fun stuff right? The best part is afterwards you retain like 0% of the information, so you get to relearn everything again for your cumulative final! This course will help combat this. It let's you know how your brain works, so you can effectively learn and commit information to memory and avoid procrastination. Some of the techniques are time-consuming, but might as well get it right the first time rather than having to relearn it. It's a short course as well and they have them going on all the time.

This page itself is partly inspired by some of the concepts they go over. Keeping this log requires me to write down in my own words what I've learned. This helps commit things to long-term memory and makes it easier to review material.

**Bonus ** [Why Procrastinators Procratinate](http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html)  
Let me preface with how amazing this blog is. I really recommend the articles on the Fermi Paradox, A.I., and his four part article on Elon Musk. Life changing stuff.

Decided to read Duckett's html book and go throught the WC3 MOOC on html5.

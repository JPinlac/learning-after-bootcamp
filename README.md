# The road to junior developer
My chronicles of getting hired as junior web developer.

### History
//More brief over view, separate section for bootcamp experience
As of December 18th, I will have completed a part-time front end development bootcamp at Grand Circus in Detroit. The bootcamp covered so much material I couldn't help but feel a little lost. The limited time frame of about 10 weeks while working 40 hours a week doesn't allow much time for independent study. Am I able to scrounge up a basic web application? Yes. Is it pretty? No.

Luckily, my circumstances we're a little more forgiving. My current job is pretty flexible about on the job learning.

# The Road to Junior Developer
### My chronicles of eventually getting hired as junior web developer. :grin:

I'm the type of person who spends way too much time finding the most time efficient way to comprehensively learn something. I even obsess over what to learn in the first place and endlessly question that decision after the fact. I hate wasting my time. This usually ends up horribly backfiring and I end up wasting more time researching options than actually learning. Even after all this, there will always be some nonoptimal decisions and hindsight is almost 20/20. So I'm hoping some of you can use this guide to save some time on deciding what to do and actually do things.   
__TL;DR: Hopefully, you can use my succeses and mistakes to help guide your journey as a developer.__

###### Why



### History

As of December 18th, I will have completed a part-time front end development bootcamp at Grand Circus in Detroit. The bootcamp covered so much material I couldn't help but feel a little lost. The limited time frame of about 10 weeks while working 40 hours a week doesn't allow much time for independent study. Am I able to scrounge up a basic web application? Yes. Is it pretty? No.

Luckily, my circumstances we're a little more forgiving. My current job is pretty flexible about on the job learning.
